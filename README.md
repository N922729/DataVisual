 ### Project Overview
 The objective of this data analysis project is to provide a comprehensive breakdown of the professional survey data.
 By meticulously analyzing various aspects of the survey data, the aim is to identify key insights that will inform decision-making processes. 

The analysis will focus on a range of factors, including demographic data, survey responses, average salary, level of satisfaction, and any trends that emerge through the data. 

### Data Source
The primary dataset utilized in the project is "DataProfessionalSurvey.xls". The dataset was obtained from a survey of data professionals conducted
 during 2022, and was selected as the main source of information for the project.

 Credit is attributed to the Alex the Analyst YouTube channel for the collection and curation of the data.

### Tools:

- Power BI for Desktop



### Data Cleaning/Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, I performed the following tasks:
- Data loading & inspection
- Handling missing values
- Data cleaning & formatting


### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved exploring the data professional responses to the key questions, such as:
- What is the overall level of satisfaction?
- Total number of survey takers
- Average age of survey takers


### Data Analysis
Includes some interesting DAX functions


### Results/Findings
The analysis results are summarized as follows:

The study involved around 630 individuals from different regions worldwide, with an average age of 30. The participants were data professionals
 who were asked to share their feedback on the programming language, life/work balance, ease of breaking into the data field, and so on. 
The study aimed to assess their perception of the language in terms of ease of use and overall appeal. 
The results showed that a majority of the respondents found Python to be a user-friendly and interesting programming language. 
However, the data professionals' satisfaction level with their remuneration was relatively low.
 On the other hand, data scientists were found to be the highest earners among the group of data professionals.

### Recommendations
 The level of satisfaction among data professionals with their income is relatively low. This can be attributed to the varying cost of living in different countries.
 The compensation of data professionals is significantly higher in the United States compared to India. The difference in payment may be due to factors
 such as the difference in the supply and demand for data professionals and the differences in the level of expertise and experience required for the job.
 Further research is recommended to explore the factors that contribute to the variation in income for data professionals in different parts of the world.
